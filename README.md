## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* The Vehicle Weight, Vehicle Length, and Ground Clearance all provide non-random variance to the mpg values. Vehicle weight is statistically much more reliable as a predictive variable.

*  Our assumed significance level is 0.05%, and the P-value of this linear model is well below that. Because we can reject the null hypothesis, the slope of the model is not zero.

* This model does predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the p-value is 5.35e-11 and the R-squared is .07149

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Based on the Total Summary the variance is 62.3 so it is within range but taking a look at each lot individually we can see that Lot 1 and 2 meet the design specifications with variances of .9 and 7.4 while Lot 3 far exceeds specifications.

## T Tests for Suspension Coils

Lot 1,2 are statistically similar to the 1500 psi where as lot 3 is statistically different.
